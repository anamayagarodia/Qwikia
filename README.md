# Qwikia

A Facebook Messenger bot that uses the Qwikia api to get articles about the topic that YOU choose, and generate questions from them on the fly.

# Why I made this bot

I love doing trivia about my favourite topics in fandom and fiction. However, all the trivia apps I use always run out of questions and so I have to answer the same questions again and again. This was my solution to the problem.

# Technologies Used

NodeJS for the backend. Heroku for deployment and Facebook for its messenger platform. I have plans to integrate api.ai and firebase in the future to provide some basic NLP to make conversations feel more life like and to provide a platform to users to rank questions they loved.
